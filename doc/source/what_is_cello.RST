Cello is an object-oriented "Extreme AMR" (Adaptive Mesh Refinement)
software framework for high performance scientific applications,
currently under active development with funding from the the National
Science Foundation (NSF AST-0808184). The framework will be portable,
usable on systems ranging from PC's and laptops to the largest HPC
platforms available.  Design goals include parallel scalability,
modifyability, and ease of use.

The development of Cello is driven by Enzo, a parallel astrophysics
and cosmology application.  The primary goal is to efficiently map
Enzo's multi-resolution multi-physics capabilities onto large parallel
computers with millions of computational units. We refer to this next
generation "exascale" branch of Enzo built using the Cello framework
as "Enzo-E", previously known as a "petascale" version, or "Enzo-P".
