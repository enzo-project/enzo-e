Enzo-E/Cello Documentation
============================

**Cello** is a highly scalable, fully-distributed array-of-octree
parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, and **Enzo-E** is a
scalable branch of the `ENZO <http://enzo-project.org/>`_ parallel
astrophysics and cosmology application that has been ported to use
Cello.  Enzo-E / Cello is currently funded by the National Science
Foundation (NSF) grant OAC-1835402, with previous funding through
NSF grants PHY-1104819, AST-0808184, and SI2-SSE-1440709.

Two fundamental differences between Enzo-E and ENZO are their AMR
design and code parallelization.  Cello implements *array of octree* AMR,
which has demonstrated scalability to date through 256K floating-point
cores of the `NSF <http://www.nsf.gov/>`_ `Blue Waters supercomputer
<http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/bluewaters>`_ at the `National
Center for Supercomputing Applications
<http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/>`_.  Unlike ENZO, which is parallelized
using MPI, Enzo-E/Cello is parallelized using `Charm++
<http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/research/charm/>`_, an OOP parallel
programming system, targeting the development of Exascale software
applications, and actively developed at the Parallel Programming
Laboratory at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

Enzo-E currently has two hyperbolic solvers: `PPM
<http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995CoPhC..89..149B>`_, an enhanced
piecewise parabolic method solver that was migrated to Enzo-E from the
ENZO code base, and `PPML <http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2960>`_, an ideal
compressible MHD solver originally implemented in serial Fortran.
More recently, physics and infrastructure capabilities have been
developed for particle methods, including an implementation of ENZO's
CIC particle-mesh gravity solver, and cosmological expansion with
comoving coordinates.  Currently we are collaborating with
`Prof. Daniel Reynolds <http://faculty.smu.edu/reynolds/>`_ on
developing and implementing a highly scalable multigrid-based linear
solver.

Getting started
---------------

The `Getting started using Enzo-E`_ section should cover everything
one needs to know to download Enzo-E / Cello and its dependent
software, configure, build, and run a small example test problem.

.. _Getting started using Enzo-E: tutorial/getting_started.html

Parameters
----------

The `Enzo-E / Cello parameter reference`_ section is a reference page
for all Enzo-E and Cello parameters, which are used to write
parameters files defining simulations to run.

.. _Enzo-E / Cello parameter reference: reference/index.html

How parameters are organized within a parameter file is described in
`Parameter files`_, which covers parameter groups, subgroups,
parameters, and data types recognized.

.. _Parameter files: user/parameters-file.html

An example parameter file is described in detail in `Parameter
file example`_.

.. _Parameter file example: user/parameters-example.html

Using and developing Enzo-E / Cello
-----------------------------------

The new `Using Enzo-E`_ section will describe in detail how to use
Enzo-E, including what methods, fields, particle types etc. are
available.  While only an outline exists now, we are working on
getting this section completed soon.

.. _Using Enzo-E: user/index.html

The new `Developing with Cello`_ section will describe how to add new
functionality to an application such as Enzo-E built on Cello,
including adding new computational methods, initial conditions, and
refinement criteria.  As with the `Using Enzo-E`_ section, this
documentation is under active development, and is mostly an outline at
this point.

PDF User and Developer Guide (depreciated)
------------------------------------------

An Enzo-E / Cello User and Developer Guide is available from the link
below.  Warning, it's big (0.2GB), and currently written as a
presentation, and some sections are somewhat outdated.  This document,
while currently still useful, is being phased out in favor of the
above online content.

Presentations given at the 2018 Enzo Days Workshop are also available
below.  They are more up-to-date, but are also still rather large.
