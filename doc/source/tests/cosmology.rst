Cosmology Tests
---------------

Tests of the enzo-e cosmology methods using simple cosmology problems. Runs PPM and Cosmology methods with cosmology variables set in the Physics parameter. Both tests output density field, x velocity, y velocity, z velocity, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, total density and potential image files and a hdf5 data file in a new directory.
