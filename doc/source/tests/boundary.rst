Boundary Condition Tests
------------------------

Runs an implosion problem on various boundary conditions in 2D and 3D. 


boundary_mixed-2d
=================

Tests boundary set to list of different boundary condition subgroups in a 2D enviroment. Boundary set to periodic on the x-axis and reflecting on the y-axis.


boundary_outflow-2d
===================

Tests boundary ``type=outflow`` in a 2D enviroment

boundary_outflow-3d
===================

Tests boundary ``type=outflow`` in a 3D enviroment


boundary_periodic-2d
====================

Tests boundary ``type=periodic`` in a 2D enviroment



boundary_periodic-3d
====================

Tests boundary ``type=periodic`` in a 3D enviroment



boundary_reflecting-2d
======================

Tests boundary ``type=reflecting`` in a 2D enviroment


boundary_reflecting-3d
======================

Tests boundary ``type=reflecting`` in a 3D enviroment
