Getting started using Enzo-E
----------------------------

This page will help you get Enzo-E and Cello up and running.  It
covers downloading the source code, porting the code to new platforms,
configuring and compiling the code, and running a sample test problem.

Other pages are available for helping to get started on specific
architectures, including the "Frontera" supercomputer at TACC and the
"Pleiades" supercomputer at NASA.

Downloading
===========

``Enzo-E / Cello`` is currently hosted on github.com (previously bitbucket.com)in beta-testing.  To obtain the latest
version of the source code, you may clone it from the
repository `Enzo-E / Cello github repository
<https://github.com/enzo-project/enzo-e.git>`_:

   ``git clone https://github.com/enzo-project/enzo-e.git``


Before compiling ``Enzo-E / Cello``, you may also need to download
and install 1.``CMake``, 2.``Charm++``, 3.``HDF5``, 4.``libpng``, 5.``libboost``, and (optionally) 6.``Grackle``:

1. Install ``CMake``
--------------------

Most systems nowaways have ``CMake`` already installed.
If not, you can get the binary distribution from the
`CMake <https://cmake.org/download/>`_ website.


2. Install ``Charm++``
----------------------

First, we install the latest `Charm++`, which now also uses `cmake` as default
build system (as example we use the pure MPI backend).

..  code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/UIUC-PPL/charm.git
  cd charm
  git checkout v7.0.0
  # Note, the directory name can be anything
  mkdir build-mpi
  cd build-mpi
  cmake -DNETWORK=mpi -DSMP=OFF ..
  make

3. Install ``HDF5``
-------------------

"`HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ is a "data model, library, and
file format for storing and managing data", and is the primary library
used by Enzo-E / Cello for data output.

If HDF5 is not already installed on your machine, it may be available
through your operating system distribution, otherwise it can be
downloaded from the `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/>`_ website.
Enzo-E / Cello currently uses the "serial" (non-MPI) version of HDF5.

4. Install ``libpng``
---------------------

"`libpng <https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>`_ is the official
PNG reference library", and is the image format used by Enzo-E / Cello.

If ``libpng`` is not already installed on your machine, it may be
available through your operating system distribution, otherwise it can
be downloaded from the `libpng
<https://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html>`_ website.

5. Install ``libboost-dev``
---------------------------

"`Boost <https://www.boost.org/>`_ provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries."

If ``libboost-dev`` is not already installed on your machine, it may be
available through your operating system distribution, otherwise it can
be downloaded from the `libboost <https://www.boost.org/>`_ website.

6. Install Grackle
------------------

By default Enzo-E requires the Grackle chemistry and cooling library.
If you do not need to use Grackle, you can simple disabling it by setting
``-DUSE_GRACKLE=OFF`` when you configure Enzo-E.
See the `Grackle documentation <https://grackle.readthedocs.io>`__ for installation
instructions.

Configuring/Building
====================

For a basic configuration on a linux system with GNU compiler stack the following
command should work out of the box. If not please report.
Also see following subsection for more configuration options.

..  code-block:: bash

  # Again, the directory name can be anything
  mkdir build-mpi
  cd build-mpi
  cmake -DCHARM_ROOT=/PATH/TO/charm/build-mpi -DEnzo-E_CONFIG=linux_gcc -DUSE_GRACKLE=OFF ..
  make

Note, if ``ninja`` is installed, the ``ninja`` build system can be used for faster build times
by adding ``-GNinja`` (before the ``..``) to the ``cmake`` command and calling ``ninja``
afterwards instead of ``make``.

The Enzo-E executable is built within ``bin/``. 

Configuration options
---------------------

Current ``cmake`` options are the following (default value at the end of the line):

* ``USE_GRACKLE`` "Use Grackle Chemistry" ON
* ``USE_DOUBLE_PREC`` "Use double precision. Turn off for single precision." ON
* ``new_output`` "Temporary setting for using new Output implementation" OFF
* ``node_size`` "Maximum number of procesess per shared-memory node (can be larger than needed)" 64
* ``trace`` "Print out detailed messages with the TRACE() series of statements" OFF
* ``verbose`` "Trace main phases" OFF
* ``trace_charm`` "Print out messages with the TRACE_CHARM() and TRACEPUP() series of statements" OFF
* ``debug`` "Whether to enable displaying messages with the DEBUG() series of
  statements. Also writes messages to out.debug.<P> where P is the
  (physical) process rank. Still requires the \"DEBUG\" group to be
  enabled in Monitor (that is Monitor::is_active(\"DEBUG\") must be true for any output) OFF
* ``debug_field`` "" OFF
* ``debug_field_face`` "" OFF
* ``check`` "Do extra run-time checking.  Useful for debugging, but can potentially slow     calculations down" OFF
* ``debug_verbose`` "Print periodically all field values.  See src/Field/field_FieldBlock.cpp" OFF
* ``memory`` "Track dynamic memory statistics.  Can be useful, but can cause problems on some systems that also override new [] () / delete [] ()" OFF
* ``balance`` "Enable charm++ dynamic load balancing" ON`
* ``balancer_included`` "Charm++ load balancer included" "CommonLBs"
* ``balancer_default`` "Charm++ load balancer to use by default" "TreeLB"
* ``use_gprof`` "Compile with -pg to use gprof for performance profiling" OFF
* ``use_performance`` "Use Cello Performance class for collecting performance
  data (currently requires global reductions, and may not be fully
  functional) (basic time data on root processor is still output)" ON
* ``use_projections`` "Compile the CHARM++ version for use with the Projections performance tool." OFF
* ``use_jemalloc`` "Use the jemalloc library for memory allocation" OFF
* ``smp`` "Use Charm++ in SMP mode." OFF
* ``use_papi`` "Use the PAPI performance API" OFF
* ``PARALLEL_LAUNCHER`` "Launcher to use for parallel tests" `charmrun`
* ``PARALLEL_LAUNCHER_NPROC_ARG`` "Argument to set number of processing elements for parallel launcher" ``+p`` (for use with ``charmrun``)
* ``PARALLEL_LAUNCHER_NPROC`` "Number of processors to run parallel unit tests" 4

All variables can be set either on the commad line by ``-D<variable>=<value>`` or
in a machine config, see below.
For example, a configure line may look like

..  code-block:: bash

  cmake -DCHARM_ROOT=$(pwd)/../../charm/build-gcc-mpi-proj -DEnzo-E_CONFIG=msu_hpcc_gcc -DGrackle_ROOT=${HOME}/src/grackle/build-gcc -Duse_projections=ON -Duse_jemalloc=ON -Dbalance=ON  ..

To see all available (and selected) options you can also run ``ccmake .`` in the
build directory (after running ``cmake`` in first place), or use the ``ccmake`` GUI 
directly to interactively configure Enzo-E by calling ``ccmake ..`` in an empty build
directory.

If packages (external libraries) are not found automatically or if the wrong one was
picked up, you can specify the search path by
``-D<package_name>_ROOT=/PATH/TO/PACKAGE/INSTALL``,
cf., the ``cmake`` example command just above.
Note, these package location are also picked up from the environment, i.e., an alternative
option  is ``export <package_name>_ROOT=/PATH/TO/PACKAGE/INSTALL`` .

The last option is a machine specific configuration file (see below).

In addition, the general `cmake` option to set basic optimization flags via
``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` with values of

* ``Release`` (typically ``-O3``),
* ``RelWithDebInfo`` (typically ``-O2 -g``), and
* ``Debug`` (typically ``-O0 -g``)

are available.

Machine files
-------------

Finally, for convenience we provide the option to set default value for your own
machine/setup, see the ``*.cmake`` files in the ``config`` directory.

You can specify compilers and option in there that will be used a default when
``cmake`` is called with ``-DEnzo-E_CONFG=my_config_name`` where ``my_config_name`` requires
a corresponding ``config/my_config_name.cmake`` to exist.
The alternative directory for the machine configuration files is a ``.enzo-e`` directory
in your home directory.
If a file with the same name exists in your ``${HOME}/.enzo-e`` directory and in the ``config``
directory only the first one will be used.
*Note*, all command line parameter take precedence over the default options.
In other words, if ``USE_DOUBLE_PREC`` is ``ON`` in the machine file (or even automatically
through the global default), the running
``cmake -DEnzo-E_CONFIG=my_config_name -DUSE_DOUBLE_PREC=OFF ..`` will result in a single
precision version of Enzo-E.

Options in the machine file can also include the paths to external libraries and
can be set via a "cached string", i.e., via

..  code-block:: cmake

  set(CHARM_ROOT "/home/user/Charm/charm/build-mpi" CACHE STRING "my charm build")

Running
=======

In this section we run Enzo-E on a simple "Hello World" test program
and take a look at Enzo-E's output.

1. Run Enzo-E
-------------

An included "Hello World" problem can be run using the following
from the ``$CELLO_HOME`` directory:

     ``charmrun +p4 bin/enzo-e input/HelloWorld/Hi.in``

This assumes that the ``charmrun`` command is in your path.  If it
is not, then you will need to include the path name as well, e.g.:

     ``~/Charm/bin/charmrun +p4 bin/enzo-e input/HelloWorld/Hi.in``

This also assumes that local connections can be established passwordless.
If errors like

..  code-block:: bash

    Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password,hostbased).
    Charmrun> Error 255 returned from remote shell (localhost:0)

are displayed a node local run (i.e., no "remote" connections even to the local host)
could be used instead by add ``++local`` to ``charmrun``, e.g.:

     ``~/Charm/bin/charmrun ++local +p4 bin/enzo-e input/HelloWorld/Hi.in``

If you receive an error like

..  code-block:: bash

    Charmrun> Timeout waiting for node-program to connect

trying running ``./bin/enzo-e`` without ``charmrun`` as crashes due to, e.g.,
libraries not being found may not be displaying.

If all goes well, Enzo-E will run the Hello World problem.  Below are
some of the generated images from the longer-running "HelloWorld.in"
problem (note "HelloWorld.in" runs for about an hour, compared to a
couple minutes for the shorter "Hi.in" input parameter file).  These
images show density and mesh hierarchy structure with blocks colored
by level and by age.

.. image:: hello-mesh-level-0165.png
   :scale: 40 %

.. image:: hello-mesh-age-0165.png
   :scale: 40 %


If you look at the ``Hi.in`` parameter file contents, you will notice that there are some ``"include"`` directives that include other files.  When Enzo-E / Cello runs, it will generate a ``"parameters.out"`` file, which is the input file but with the included files inlined.  This ``"parameters.out"`` file is itself a valid Enzo-E / Cello parameter file (though you may wish to rename it before using it as a parameter file to avoid it being overwritten.)

If you encounter any problems in getting Enzo-E to compile or run,
please contact the Enzo-E / Cello community at cello-l@ucsd.edu, and
someone will be happy to help resolve the problems.
