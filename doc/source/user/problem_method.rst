Enzo-E Methods
**************

This section decribes all Methods available in Enzo-E: what they do,
what method-specific parameters they have, what fields / particles
they access or update, and how interrelated Methods are intended to be
used with each other.

Current Enzo-E methods available include those listed below.

``"accretion"`` method
======================

For cells within a spherical accretion zone around a sink particle, mass is removed
(i.e., the values of the density field are reduced) and added to the sink particle.
The momentum change of gas is in the accretion zone due to the mass loss is accounted
for by changing the momentum of the sink particle, so that total momentum is
conserved. The amount of mass removed is determined by which "flavor" of accretion is
chosen (specified by the ``"accretion:flavor"`` parameter), as well as the values
of the "density threshold" (specified by ``"accretion:physical_density_threshold_cgs"``) and the
"maximum mass fraction" (specified by ``"accretion:max_mass_fraction"``).

In ``"threshold"`` flavor accretion, the change in density of each cell is zero if the current
density is below the density threshold. If the current density is above the density threshold,
the change in density is the current density minus the density threshold, or the maximum mass
fraction times the current density, whichever is smaller.

In ``"bondi_hoyle"`` flavor accretion, the density change in each cell is calculated according
to the method described in Mark R. Krumholz et al 2004, ApJ, 611, 399. Furthermore, the
density change is limited in the same way as in ``"threshold"`` accretion.

In ``"flux"`` flavor accretion, the density change in each cell is calculated according to the
method described in Andreas Bleuler & Romain Teyssier 2004, MNRAS, 445, 4015-4036.
Furthermore, the density change is limited in the same way as in ``"threshold"`` accretion.

In ``"dummy"`` flavor accretion, no accretion is done (essentially, the accretion rate is zero).
This can be useful for testing purposes.

This method can only be used if ``"merge_sinks"`` is also used, with ``"merge_sinks"`` preceding
``"accretion"``. In addition, this method requires the use of three spatial dimensions.

This method requires the following fields (in addition to the fields required by the hydro
method): ``"density_source"``, ``"density_source_accumulate"``, ``"mom_dens_x_source"``,
``"mom_dens_x_source_accumulate"``, ``"mom_dens_y_source"``, ``"mom_dens_y_source_accumulate"``,
``"mom_dens_z_source"``, and ``mom_dens_z_source_accumulate"``. In addition, if sink particles
have a ``"metal_fraction"`` attribute, there must be a ``"metal_density"`` field.

This method also requires sink particles to have the following attributes: ``"mass"``, ``"x"``,
``"y"``, ``"z"``, ``"vx"``, ``"vy"``, ``"vz"``, and ``"accretion_rate"``, which must all be
of type ``"default"``.

.. _balance_method:

``"balance"`` method
====================

While the Charm++ parallel programming system supports many load balancers,
Enzo-E also implements its own dynamic load balancer based on space-filling
curves. As such, it relies on the "ordering_morton" Method to be called
before "balance".

There are currently no method-specific parameters, though ``schedule``
parameters are likely to be useful, since one generally doesn't want
or need to run the load balancer every cycle. Also, as further
orderings are implemented beyond the "Morton" ordering, a parameter is
likely to be introduced in the future for specifying the ordering to use.

restrictions
------------

There are two known potential pitfalls when using the built-in Enzo-E load balancer.

First, there is a bug related to the ordering of Methods in ``Method :
list``, where the simulation can hang if ``balance`` is the last
Method. To bypass this bug, please use ``order_morton`` and
``balance`` at the beginning of the ``Method : list`` parameter.

Second, the minimum level parameter ``Adapt : min_level`` should be set
such that the coarsest level (which may be negative) is a single block.
(This restriction is likely to be lifted in the near future when this
particular parameter is removed.) (Also note this is a restriction related to the
"order_morton" method, not the "balance" method.)

For example, to load balance a simulation with a 4^3 root-level blocking
(4 root-level blocks of any size along each axis), one can use the following:

.. code::

   Mesh {
      root_blocks = [4, 4, 4];    # must be a regular blocking!
      # ...
   }

   Adapt {
      min_level = -2;             # must be log_2 of root_blocks!
      # ...
   }

   Method {
      list = ["order_morton", "balance", "ppm" ];
      order_morton { schedule { var = "cycle"; step = 20; } }
      balance      { schedule { var = "cycle"; step = 20; } }
      # ...
   }

``"comoving_expansion"`` method
===============================

Adds the comoving expansion terms to the physical variables.
   
``"grackle"`` method
====================

Calls methods provided by the external Grackle 3.0 chemistry and
cooling library.

.. _using-grackle-gamma-with-HD:

Compatability with hydro/mhd solvers
------------------------------------

The ``"grackle"`` method is compatible with both the ``"ppm"`` and the
``"mhd_vlct"`` methods. The convention is to list the hydro method
before ``"grackle"`` in the ``Field:list`` parameter.  This
configuration performs advection and radiative cooling in an
operator-split manner (*Note: there isn't currently support for
performing radiative cooling during the predictor step of the
VL+CT solver*).

Integration with hydro-solvers is self-consistent when
``Method:Grackle:primordial_chemistry`` has values of ``0`` or ``1``.
However, the integration is somewhat inconsistent when the parameter
exceeds ``1``. While users shouldn't be too concerned about this
latter scenario unless they are simulating conditions where
:math:`{\rm H}_2` makes up a significant fraction of the gas density,
we describe the inconsistencies in greater detail below.

When ``Method:Grackle:primordial_chemistry > 1``, the Grackle library
explicitly models chemistry involving :math:`{\rm H}_2` and how it
modifies the adiabtic index. Grackle's routines treat
:math:`\gamma_0`, the "nominal adiabatic index" specified by
``Physics:fluid_props:eos:gamma``, as the adiabatic index for all
monatomic species (this should be ``5.0/3.0``). To that end, Grackle
supplies functions that can effectively be represented as
:math:`\gamma(e, n_{{\rm H}_2}, n_{\rm other})` and :math:`p(\rho, e,
n_{{\rm H}_2}, n_{\rm other})`. In these formulas:

- :math:`p`, :math:`\rho` and :math:`e` correspond to the quantities
  held by the ``pressure``, ``density`` and ``internal_energy``
  fields.  *(Note: the* :math:`\gamma` *function's dependence on*
  :math:`e` *accounts for the dependence of* :math:`\gamma_{{\rm
  H}_2}` *on temperature)*

- :math:`n_{{\rm H}_2}` specifies the number density of
  :math:`{\rm H}_2`. :math:`n_{\rm other}` specifies a selection of
  the other primordial species (that roughly approximate the total
  number density). In practice, these are computed from passively
  advected species fields.

There are a handful of locations within the ``"ppm"`` and
``"mhd_vlct"`` methods where this treatment is relevant:

1. **Computing the timestep:** each hydro/mhd
   method uses the :math:`p(\rho, e, n_{{\rm H}_2}, n_{\rm other})`
   function for the pressure values. However, they both use
   :math:`\gamma_0` in other places (such as the occurence of
   adiabatic index in the sound speed formula).

2. **Pre-reconstruction pressure calculation:** each hydro/mhd
   solver internally computes the pressure that is to be reconstructed
   with :math:`p=(\gamma_0 - 1)e\rho`.

3. **Riemann Solver:** in each hydro/mhd solver, the Riemann Solver
   completely ignore the grackle supplied functions.

4. **VL+CT Energy floor and DE synchronization:** the internal energy
   floor is computed from the pressure floor using: :math:`e_{\rm
   floor} = \frac{p_{\rm floor}}{(\gamma_0 - 1)\rho}` (thus,
   :math:`p_{\rm floor}` may exceed :math:`p(\rho, e_{\rm floor},
   \ldots)`). Additionally, synchronizing the internal energy with
   total energy relies on :math:`\gamma_0`.

5. **PPM reconstruction:** uses :math:`\gamma_0`.

``"gravity"`` method
====================

Particle-mesh ("PM") method component to compute gravitational
potential given a total density field, and calculate associated
acceleration fields.

``"heat"`` method
=================

A sample Method for implementing forward-euler to solve the heat equation.   
   
``"merge_sinks"`` method
========================

Merges together sink particles which are separated by less than a given
"merging radius". This is done by copying all sink particles to / from
all neighbouring blocks. A Friend-of-Friends algorithm is used to
partition particles into groups, where all particles within a given group
are separated by less than a merging radius. If a group has more than one
particle, one of the particles has its properties changed: its position
becomes that of the centre-of-mass of the group, and it takes the total
mass, momentum and mass fraction of the whole group.
In addition, its 'lifetime' attribute is set to be the maximum of the group,
its 'creation_time' attribute is set to be the minimum of the group, and its
'id' attribute is set to the minimum of the group. Other particles in the
group are marked for deletion. The final step is for each block to delete
all the remaining sink particles which are 'out-of-bounds' of the block.

This method requires sink particles to have the following attributes: ``"mass"``, ``"x"``,
``"y"``, ``"z"``, ``"vx"``, ``"vy"``, ``"vz"``, ``"is_copy"``, ``"id"``, ``"lifetime"``,
and ``"creation_time"``. All these attributes must be of type ``"default"``, except for
``"is_copy"`` and ``"id"`` which must be of type ``"int64"``. Furthermore, ``"is_copy"``
must be initialized to 0 for all particles.

This method also requires that the number of root blocks across all axes is greater than
2, i.e., that ``"Mesh:root_blocks" = [a,b,c]``, where ``a``, ``b``, and ``c`` are all
greater than 2.

This procedure cannot handle the case where particles originally
from non-neighbouring blocks are put into the same FoF group. If this is
found to occur, the program stops and prints an error message. This situation
is unlikely to happen, unless the merging radius is too large relative
to the block size.

Currently this will only run in unigrid mode. This is because this method
will only work correctly if all blocks containing sink particles are of the
same size, or equivalently, on the same refinement level.
For this reason, there is a check in the constructor of EnzoMethodMergeSinks
for whether ``"Adapt: max_level"`` is equal to zero. In future, we plan to
implement a refinement condition that
any block containing a sink particle needs to be on the highest level of
refinement. In this case, the assumption that
blocks containing sink particles are all on the same level of refinement
would be valid.

WARNING: there is currently a memory leak issue when running with this method
which can cause Enzo-E to crash in mysterious ways. If this problem is
encountered, it is advised to increase the batch size parameter
(``"Particle:batch_size"``) by a factor of a few
before attempting to run again. To be completely safe, the user can set a
batch size larger than the total number of sink particles in the whole
simulation, which should be feasible for small test problems.

``"mhd_vlct"`` method
=====================

This implements the VL + CT (van Leer + Constrained Transport) unsplit
Godunov method described by `Stone & Gardiner (2009)
<https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009NewA...14..139S>`_
. This solver operates in 2 modes (designated by the required
``Method:mhd_vlct:mhd_choice`` parameter):

  1. a pure hydrodynamical mode (it cannot handle magnetic fields)
  2. a MHD mode.

The algorithm is a predictor-corrector scheme, with attributes similar
to the MUSCL-Hancock method. For both modes, the method includes two
main steps. First the values are integrated to the half
time-step. Then, the values at the half time-step are used to
caluclate the change in the quantities over the full time-step.

In the MHD mode, the algorithm is combined with the constrained
transport method. The primary representation of the magnetic field,
:math:`\vec{B}`, components are stored in 3 face-centered Cello fields.
In more detail:

  - :math:`B_x` is stored on the x-faces
  - :math:`B_y` is stored on the y-faces
  - :math:`B_z` is stored on the z-faces

The method also tracks components of the magnetic fields at the cell-centers,
which just store the average of the values from the cell's faces.

Currently, this method only support 3-dimensional problems.  In the
future, alternative modes supporting MHD could easily be implemented
that use divergence-cleaning schemes instead of constrained transport.

In hydro-mode, none of the 6 fields used to store the magnetic field should
be defined.
       
At initialization the face-centered magnetic field should be
divergence free. Trivial configurations (e.g. a constant magnetic
field everywhere) can be provided with the ``"value"``
initializer. For non-trivial configurations, we have provide the
``"vlct_bfield"`` initializer which can initialize the magnetic fields
(face-centered and cell-centered) from expression(s) given in the
parameter file for component(s) of the magnetic vector potential.

``fluid_props`` compatability
-----------------------------

This method makes use of the ``density`` and ``pressure`` floor parameters that are set in the ``physics:fluid_props:floors`` section of the parameter file.
See :ref:`using-fluid_props-floors` for more details about specifying these parameters.
This method requires that both parameters are specified and that they have positive values.

This method is also compatible with the ``"modern"`` dual-energy formalism.
See :ref:`using-fluid_props-de` for additional details.

.. _using-vlct-reconstruction:

reconstruction
--------------

This subsection details the available interpolation methods for
reconstructing the left and right states of the cell-centered
interfaces. Presently, all available methods perform reconstruction
on cell-centered primitive quantites,
:math:`{\bf w} = (\rho, {\bf v}, p, {\bf B})`

To simplify the determination of the necessary number of ghost
zones for a given combination of reconstruction algorithms on
a unigrid mesh, we define the concepts of "stale depth" and
"staling rate". We define a "stale" value as a value that needs
to be refreshed. "Stale depth" indicates the number of field
entries, starting from the outermost field values on a block,
that the region encompassing "stale" values extends over. Every
time quantities are updated over a (partial/full) timestep,
the stale depth increases. We define the amount by which it
increases as the "staling rate" (which depends on the choice
of interpolation method).

For a unigrid simulation, the number of required ghost zones
is given by the sum of the staling rates for each selected
reconstruction method.

We provide the names used to specify each available method in
the input file, the associated staling depth, and a brief
description.

       2``. `As in Enzo, the default value is 1.5. A value of 1 is the
       most dissipative and it is equivalent to the traditional minmod
       limiter. A value of 2 is the least dissipative and it

       slope is defined in terms of the left- and right-differences:`
       :math:`\delta{\bf w}_{L,i}={\bf w}_{i}-{\bf w}_{i-1}` `and`
       :math:`\delta{\bf w}_{R,i}={\bf w}_{i-1}-{\bf w}_{i+1}`.  `If
       the signs of the differences don't match (or at least 1 is 0),
       then the limited slope is 0. Otherwise the limited slope is the
       harmonic mean of the differences.`

We provide a few notes about the choice of interpolator for this algorithm:

   * The recommended choices of reconstruction algorithms are ``"nn"`` for the
     half-timestep and then piecewise-linear reconstruction for the
     full-timestep (most test problems have been run using ``plm`` with
     ``theta_limiter=2``, matching the integrator description in
     `Stone & Gardiner 2009
     <https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009NewA...14..139S>`_ ). Using ``"nn"``
     both times also works, however tests show that errors arise when
     piecewise linear reconstruction is used both times.
   * It is supposed to be possible to reconstruct the characteristic quantities
     for this method or to use higher order reconstruction in place of ``"plm"``
   * Reconstruction is always performed on the cell-centered magnetic fields.
     After reconstructing values along a given axis, the values of the
     reconstructed magnetic field component for that axis are replaced by the
     face-centered magnetic field values.

.. _using-vlct-riemann-solver:

riemann solvers
---------------

This subsection details the available Riemann Solvers. Currently all
available Riemann Solvers are defined to use magnetic fields, however,
they all appropriately handle the cases where the magnetic fields are
unformly 0. We provide a list of the names used to specify each
Riemann Solver in the input file, and a brief description for each of
them:

  * ``"hll"`` The HLL approximate Riemann solver with wavespeeds
    bounds estimated as :math:`S_L = \min(u_L - a_L, u_R - a_R)` and
    :math:`S_R = \max(u_L + a_L, u_R + a_R)`. This is one of the
    proposed methods from Davis, 1988, SIAM J. Sci. and Stat. Comput.,
    9(3), 445–473. The same wavespeed estimator was used in MHD HLL
    solver implemented for Enzo's Runge Kutta solver. Currently, this
    has only been implemented for MHD mode and it will raise an error
    as it isn't tested.

  * ``"hlle"`` The HLLE approximate Riemann solver - the HLL solver
    with wavespeed bounds estimated according to
    Einfeldt, 1988, SJNA, 25(2), 294–318. This method allows the
    min/max eigenvalues of Roe's matrix to be wavespeed estimates. For a
    description of the procedure for MHD quantities, see
    `Stone et al. (2008)
    <https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJS..178..137S>`_ .
    If using an HLL Riemann Solver, this is the recommended choice.
    Currently, this has only been implemented for MHD mode.

  * ``"hllc"`` The HLLC approximate Riemann solver.
    For an overview see Toro, 2009, *Riemann Solvers and Numerical
    Methods for Fluid Dynamics*, Springer-Verlag. This is a solver for
    hydrodynamical problems that models contact and shear waves. The
    wavespeed bounds are estimated according to the Einfeldt approach.
    This can only be used in hydro mode.
    
  * ``"hlld"`` The HLLD approximate Riemann solver described in
    Miyoshi & Kusano, 2005. JCP, 315, 344. The wavespeed bounds are
    estimated according to eqn 67 from the paper. This reduces to an
    HLLC Riemann Solver when magnetic fields are zero (the wavespeed
    bounds will differ from ``"hllc``). This can only be used in MHD
    mode.


.. note::

      When the dual-energy formalism is in use, all of the solvers treat
      the internal energy as a passively advected scalar.

      This is not completely self-consistent with the assumptions made by the
      HLLD solver. Unlike the other HLL-solvers which assume constant
      pressure in the intermediate regions of the Riemann Fan the HLLD solver
      assumes constant total pressure. It is unclear whether this causes any
      problems.

``"m1_closure"``: multigroup radiative transfer   
===============================================

Enzo-E's multigroup M1 Closure radiative transfer solver. The M1 Closure solver is implemented following 
`Rosdahl et al. (2013) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.436.2188R/abstract>`_.

This method adds the following capabilities:

1. **Photon injection:** Photons are sourced from star particles and CiC-deposited 
   onto the mesh using a cloud radius of one cell width. Depositions occuring at 
   block boundaries are communicated to neighboring blocks via ghost zone refresh with 
   ``set_accumulate = true``. This method accesses the ``"luminosity`` attribute 
   for ``"star"`` particles, where luminosity is in units of :math:`\mathrm{s}^{-1}`. 
   One can provide an SED using the ``SED`` parameter and specifying ``m1_closure:radiation_spectrum="SED"``. 
   Alternatively, one can specify ``m1_closure:radiation_spectrum="blackbody"``, in which case 
   a blackbody spectrum will be integrated. Radiation from recombination is also 
   optionally included by setting the ``recombination_radiation`` parameter. 

2. **Photon transport:** The transport equation is solved to update the radiation fields. 
   Attenuation is optionally included with the ``attenuation`` parameter.

3. **Photoionization and heating:** This method calculates photoionization and heating rates, 
   which can then be accessed by the ``"grackle"`` method with ``Method:grackle:with_radiative_transfer=true``.
   Photoionization cross sections can either be provided in the parameter file or calculated inline. 
   This is controlled using the ``m1_closure:cross_section_calculator`` parameter.

This is a reduced speed-of-light (RSOL) method, meaning that the value of the speed of light can be varied
by setting the ``m1_closure:clight_fraction`` parameter. The radiation timescale is generally set by 
the speed of light, so a smaller speed of light will allow the simulation to progress faster. 
Some care must be taken when choosing the value for the RSOL, as the approximation is more valid in dense gas.
The general rule of thumb is the the chosen RSOL must be much less than the typical I-front propagation
speed in the medium.  For densities typical for the interstellar medium 
:math:`\left(10^{-2}\,\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3} - 10^{1}\,\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\right)`, fractions as low as 
:math:`10^{-2}\,\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}` are valid. For simulations that seek to resolve
the reionization of the intergalactic medium, however, the true value of speed of light must be taken in order for reionization to occur at the correct time. 
See Section 4 of `Rosdahl et al. (2013) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.436.2188R/abstract>`_ for a more detailed discussion.

This method **must** be used in tandem with the ``"m1_closure"`` initializer by appending ``"m1_closure"`` to 
``Initial:list``.

.. note:: 

   Additional term in the radiative transfer equation corresponding to cosmological redshift not yet included. As such, redshifting of radiation into and out of groups is not captured.

   The radiation timescale is set by the courant condition :math:`\Delta t\leq\frac{\Delta x}{3 c_r}`. 
   For :math:`c_r=c`, this will result in a timestep that is **very** small. Subcycling of radiative transfer
   with respect to hydrodynamics will be implemented soon!

   Photochemistry is only supported for six-species: HI, HII, HeI, HeII, HeIII, and :math:`e^-`.

Required Fields 
---------------

The evolved fields are ``"photon_density_i"``, ``"flux_x_i"``, ``"flux_y_i"``, and ``"flux_z_i"``, 
where photon densities and fluxes are in units of :math:`[L]^{-3}` :e:`and` :math:`[L]^2[T]^{-1}`, 
respectively, and :math:`i` denotes the group number. A set of fields must be defined for each group, and
fluxes must be defined in the x, y, and z directions regardless of the dimensionality of the simulation.
For technical reasons, an additional field called ``"photon_density_i_deposit"`` must be defined for each group.

For example, a simulation that evolves three groups must define these fifteen fields: 
``"photon_density_0"``, ``"photon_density_0_deposit"``, ``"flux_x_0"``, ``"flux_y_0"``, ``"flux_z_1"``, 
``"photon_density_1"``, ``"photon_density_1_deposit"``, ``"flux_x_1"``, ``"flux_y_1"``, ``"flux_z_1"``, 
``"photon_density_2"``, ``"photon_density_2_deposit"``, ``"flux_x_2"``, ``"flux_y_2"``, ``"flux_z_2"``.

Nine additional fields must be defined corresponding to the elements of the 3D radiation pressure tensor:
``"P00"``, ``"P01"``, ``"P02"``, 
``"P10"``, ``"P11"``, ``"P12"``, 
``"P20"``, ``"P21"``, ``"P22"`` 
Note that only these nine fields are required, regardless of the number of radiation groups specified.

Photionization and heating rates are calculated and stored in the following fields: 
``"RT_HI_ionization_rate"``, ``"RT_HeI_ionization_rate"``, ``"RT_HeII_ionization_rate"``, and ``"RT_heating_rate"``.

``"order_morton"`` method
=========================

This method is used to compute the "Morton-ordering" of blocks in the AMR
hierarchy. This is a space-filling curve with moderate locality properties.

This method is typically used with other methods, including
``"check"`` and ``"balance"``. Output are long integer Block scalar data
``"order_morton:index"`` and ``"order_morton::count`` that give the
unique index of the block in the ordering 0 <= index < CkNumPes(), and
the total number of blocks (which is the same for all blocks).

See the :ref:`"balance" method <balance_method>` section for a code example.
The ``"order_morton"`` method currently has no method-specific parameters,
though is typically called with a ``schedule`` matching that of the methods
that depend on the ordering.

Note: the name of this method may change in the future to ``"order"``,
with ``"morton"`` being provided as a parameter to specify the
ordering type.

restrictions
------------

Currently, the minimum level parameter ``Adapt : min_level`` must be set
such that the coarsest level (which may be negative) is a single block.
This restriction is likely to be lifted in the near future since this parameter
will soon be obsolete.

particles
---------

For a given particle type to be deposited to the total density field,
it must be part of the ``"is_gravitating"`` group, and must have either
an attribute called ``"mass"``, or a constant called ``"mass"``, but
not both.

If ``"mass"`` is an attribute, we loop through the mass attribute array
to get the mass of each particle; and if ``"mass"`` is a constant with a
value specified in the input parameter file, the mass of each particle is
equal to this value. In either case, the value of the divided by the cell

a CIC interpolation scheme.

``"sink_maker"`` method
=======================

This method runs on blocks at the highest level of refinement, and forms sink particles in cells
which satisy certain criteria.

First, the gas density in the cell must be larger than the
density threshold, which is specified by the ``"sink_maker:physical_density_threshold_cgs"``
parameter. If so, the mass of the potential sink particle is
:math:`V_{cell} \times \max(\rho - \rho_{thresh}, f_{max} \, \rho)`, where :math:`V_{cell}` is the
cell volume, :math:`\rho` is the cell gas density, :math:`\rho_{thresh}` is the density
threshold, and :math:`f_{max}` is the maximum fraction of the cell mass which can be turned
into a sink particle in one timestep, which is specified by the
``"sink_maker:maximum_mass_fraction"`` parameter. This mass must be greater
than the minimum sink mass, which is specified by ``"sink_maker:min_sink_mass_solar"`` (in solar
mass units).

Next, the local Jeans length :math:`\lambda_J` is calculated, where
:math:`\lambda_J = \frac{\pi c_s^2}{G \rho}`, where :math:`c_s` is the sound speed of the gas
in the cell, and :math:`G` is the gravitational constant. It is then checked whether
:math:`\lambda_J < N_J \times h_{max}`, where :math:`N_J` is specified by
``"sink_maker:jeans_length_resolution_cells"``, and :math:`h_{max} = max(h_x, h_y, h_z)`, where
:math:`h_x`, :math:`h_y`, and :math:`h_z` are the cell widths along the x-, y- and z-axes,
respectively.

The next check is that the flow is converging. This is done by computing the strain tensor,
given by :math:`A_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \, \left( \frac{dv_i}{dx_j} + \frac{dv_j}{dx_i} \right)`.
Since this tensor / matrix is real and symmetric, it has three real eigenvalues, and the check
is equivalent to checking that all three eigenvalues are negative.

The final check is optional, i.e., it is only done if ``"sink_maker:check_density_maximum"``
is "true", and a cell will pass this check if it is a local density maximum, that is, its
density is larger than the density in all 26 neighboring cells.

If a cell passes all the checks that are performed, a sink particle is created. Its position
is the coordinates of the center of the cell, plus a small random offset. The maximum size
of the random offset is controlled by ``"sink_maker:max_offset_cell_fraction"``.

This method requires sink particles to have the following attributes: ``"mass"``, ``"x"``,
``"y"``, ``"z"``, ``"vx"``, ``"vy"``, ``"vz"``, and ``"creation_time"``, which must all be
of type ``"default"``; and ``"id"`` and ``"is_copy"``, which must be of type ``"int64"``.
If sink particles have a ``"metal_fraction"`` attribute, there must be a
``"metal_density"`` field.
