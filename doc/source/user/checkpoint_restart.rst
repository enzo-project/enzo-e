Checkpoint / restart
********************

Enzo-E can perform checkpoint dumps to save the current state, and can
read them at initialization to continue a simulation where it left
off. Setting up checkpointing involves including methods in the
`Method` parameter group, and provided a schedule for them. Restarting
requires adding a small number of parameters to a parameter file to
turn on restart, and where the checkpoint files are located.


==========
Checkpoint
==========

.. code-block:: python

   Method {
     ...
     list = [ "order", "check", ... ];
     order {
        schedule { var = "cycle";  start = 5;  step = 5;  }
     }
     check {
        schedule { var = "cycle";  start = 5;  step = 5;  }
        dir = [ "Check-%02d", "cycle" ];
        num_files = 4;
     }
     ...
   }

This example writes checkpoint dumps every 5 cycles, starting with the 5th
cycle.

See the ``input/Checkpoint/test_cosmo-checkpoint.in`` parameter
file for a working example of writing checkpoint directories.

Also see the :ref:`order method` section on more information about the
required ``"order"`` method, and how to use multiple ordering methods
in the same simulation.

.. note::
   Currently, there is a restriction that the domain blocking must
   be square (2D) or cubical (3D), have a power-of-two blocking along
   the axes, and the ``Adapt:min_level`` parameter must
   be set such that the coarsest (negative) level is a single block.
   For example, if ``Mesh:root_blocks = [ 16, 16, 16]``, then
   ``Adapt:min_level`` must be initialized to ``4`` ( :math:`= log_2 16` ).

=======
Restart
=======

To restart from a checkpoint directory, edit a copy of the original parameter
file to add two parameters, ``Initial:restart`` and ``Initial:restart_dir``.
For example, to restart the problem in the previous "Checkpoint" section
at cycle 50, one would add the following:

.. code-block:: python

   Initial {

      restart = true;
      restart_dir = "Check-50";
   }

Note that it's also possible to rerun with some parameters modified,
for example different linear solver convergence criteria or different
mesh refinement criteria. The main limitation is that the simulation
data cannot change on restart: you cannot add new fields, new particle
types or attributes, or change the number of root-level blocks or
block sizes. You `can` restart with more (or fewer) processors, though
the constraint that the number of processors must be at most the
number of root-level blocks must still be satisfied.

The parameter file ``input/Checkpoint/test_cosmo-restart.in`` is the
"restart" counterpoint to the "checkpoint" example mentioned in the
previous section.
