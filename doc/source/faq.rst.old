Currently particle support is being designed and implemented.  Key features planned
include the following:

   1. Block-local coordinate systems for positions
   2. Positions stored as integers
   3. Packed particle data to optimize memory use and allocation/deallocations

Most notable limitations include but are not limited to:

   1. Linear interpolation only--not conservative
   2. 4 ghost zones required for interpolation scheme
   3. Nagging discrepencies between serial and parallel runs
