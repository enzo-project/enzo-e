               numerical solution of differential equations.~The 
               multilevel solution of elliptic partial 
               differential equations can be combined with 
               adaptive mesh refinement and an adaptive choice 
               of the discretization order.~Additionally, 
               adaptivity may be built into the relaxation and 
               the multilevel cycling strategy.~The goal of 
               these \em fully adaptive methods is to spend work 
               only where it is most effective in the solution 
               process.~This approach includes concepts like \em 
               local relaxation and not only leads to 
               particularly fast convergence but also to 
               additional robustness and generality.~The 
               efficient implementation of fully adaptive 
               multilevel methods in a finite element framework
