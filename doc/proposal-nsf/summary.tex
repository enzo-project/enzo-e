\textbf{Project Summary} \\

% Cello + Enzo-II
%
%   formalization of Enzo-P development as a physics application built
%   on a new independent extreme AMR framework
%
%
%
This project proposes to develop \cello, a new parallel adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) software framework.  The purpose of \cello\ is to
enable researchers to write multiscale multiphysics science software
applications that can harness the enormous computing power of current
and future world-class HPC platforms.  The distinguishing
characteristic relative to existing AMR frameworks is the aggressive
pursuit at the onset of extreme scalability, both in terms of software
data structures and hardware parallelism.
%
Integral to developing \cello\ will be developing \enzoii, a petascale
astrophysics and cosmology application built on top of the \cello\
framework.  \enzoii\ will not only help drive development of the
underlying \cello\ framework, but it will serve as the successor to
the \enzo\ terascale astrophysics and cosmology community code.  Both
the \enzoii\ science application, and the underlying \cello\ extreme
AMR software framework, will be released and supported as community
software.

\textit{Software sustainability} will be built on the legacy of the
Laboratory for Computational Astrophysics (LCA), which has a proven
track record of over 15 years of successfully developing and providing
user support for community codes.
%Furthermore, the LCA is
%continually improving its methods of software design, software quality
%control, and end-user support.
%
\textit{Software self-management} will be an integral component of the
\cello\ software design, with software resilience a high priority.
%
The \cello\ framework will be designed to detect hardware and software
faults, identify performance and numerical issues, and dynamically
reconfigure to always perform with the highest possible efficiency on
available hardware components.
%
\textit{Energy efficiency} is implicitly handled in the underlying
adaptive mesh refinement approach, which dynamically targets the
application of available hardware resources to where they are needed,
and avoids applying resources to where they are not.  The adaptivity
of AMR translates directly to energy savings.

% The proposed AMR framework would enable application
% developers to write multiphysics applications for simulating phenomena
% on an unprecedented range of spacial and temporal scales.

% AMR will be implemented using a modified octree-based approach.  Nodes
% of an octree will be associated with both logically Cartesian grid
% blocks and groups of particles, for Eulerian, Lagrangian, and hybrid
% methods for solving coupled hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic PDE's.
% Unlike standard octree-based AMR, grid block sizes may vary, and
% individual blocks may be distributed, such that optimal ``unigrid''
% parallel performance is recovered in subregions of the problem domain
% that are smooth.  Additionally, higher refinement factors, such as
% $r=4$ or even $r=8$, will be supported for particularly ``deep'' AMR
% problems; this will be designed in a way that still maintains at most
% $r=2$ level jumps, and will retain the high efficiency of the octree
% data structure.

% Parallelization will be primarily data parallel, with task
% parallelization also available to augment the data parallelism.  A
% variety of parallelization technologies will be supported from the
% start, beginning with the message-driven processor virtualization
% approach provided by the
% \charm\ framework~\cite{KaBo07}~\cite{wwwcharm}.  Other
% parallelization methods used will include one-sided message passing
% via the MPI-2.0 library~\cite{wwwmpi}, the partitioned global address
% space (PGAS) approach via the UPC language~\cite{wwwupc}~\cite{upc},
% and shared memory parallel programming using the OpenMP
% API~\cite{wwwopenmp}.  Hybrid parallelism will be supported, including
% MPI with OpenMP and UPC with MPI.  Dynamic load balancing of parallel
% tasks will include hierarchical methods, which will improve mapping
% the distributed software data structures to the hierarchical hardware
% components of HPC platforms.

% Fault tolerance and software resilience are also crucial factors at
% extreme scales.  The checkpoint-to-disk paradigm is known to be
% ultimately non-scalable, so this project will support other alternatives,
% including checkpoint-to-memory, or other options as they become
% technologically feasible.  Our framework will be designed at the onset
% to be resistant to memory, compute component, network, disk, and
% software failures.
% 
% This project plans to make the framework and accompanying documentation freely
% available for use by the research community.  The result of this
% project will be a software framework that allows application
% developers to write multiphysics applications for simulating phenomena
% on an unprecedented range of spacial and temporal scales for many
% years to come.

% The proposed AMR framework would enable application
% developers to write 

The \textbf{intellectual merit} in the project includes 
%

The team of adaptive mesh refinement experts---with overlapping yet
targeted areas of expertise in software development, high performance
computing, and computational astrophysics---form the perfect group to
design, implement, and rigorously test the proposed software.  The
resulting astrophysics application \enzoii\ will build on the existing
success of \enzo.
