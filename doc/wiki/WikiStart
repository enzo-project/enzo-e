[[TOC]]

Cello, AKA "Enzo-P", is designed to be an object-oriented redesign of the [http://lca.ucsd.edu/projects/enzo Enzo] astrophysics and cosmology application.  It will include an overhaul of the distributed adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and distributed particles data-structures, but will retain existing core physics kernels.  The object-oriented programming approach is expected to greatly ease maintaining and enhancing the code, which will in turn enable quickly adapting the code to future high-performance computing platforms as they continue to rapidly evolve.

=== Wiki Pages ===

The wiki pages are for users and developers to interactively collaborate on different aspects of Cello's development. 

 * '''[NotesWishList Wish List]''': The "Wish List" is for listing desired features and functionality.  All future users of Cello are encouraged to review this list and add their own items.

 * '''[NotesParameters  Parameters]''': The "Parameters" wiki pages are for developing the parameter file syntax, grammar, and list of parameters.  All future users of Cello are encouraged to review these pages and provide feedback.

 * '''[NotesComponents  Components]''': The "Components" wiki pages are for designing the Cello software at the component and class levels.  All developers of Cello are encouraged to review these pages and provide feedback.

 * '''[NotesDesignPatterns  Design Patterns]''': A list of design patterns used in Cello.

 * '''[NotesCodingStandards  Coding Guidelines]''': The "Coding Guidelines" page is for establishing basic suggestions and guidelines for Cello developers.  All developers must read these guidelines and are encouraged to provide feedback.

 * '''[NotesTestProblems  Tests]''': The "Tests" pages are for developing application tests, which will be used for developing input file format and [NotesParameters Parameters] as well as testing.

=== Software Documents ===

The Latex software documents serve to record the "official" vision and scope, requirements, design, and tests that were developed and decided on in the wiki pages.
