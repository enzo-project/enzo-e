# Problem: Legacy-Checkpoint-Restart PPM 2D Implosion Problem
# Author: Matthew Abruzzo and James Bordner
#
# This is an input file for testing the legacy checkpoint-restart machinery
# that is based on the charm++ machinery.
#
# In more detail, this mostly acts like a template-file that is used by the
# testing tool. In practice, the testing tool will:
# - provide a Stopping section and an Output section.
# - use the contents of Field:list to determine which fields to compare before
#   and after a restart
# Details are provided on the website documentation about how you can see the
# full parameter files that are generated in this test.
#
#
# Note
# ----
# The precise problem-setup considered here is the 2D Implosion problem. These
# conditions were adapted from an earlier parameter-file put together by James
# Bordner for testing Checkpoint-Restart functionality
