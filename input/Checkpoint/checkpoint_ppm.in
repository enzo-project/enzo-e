# Problem: Checkpoint-Restart PPM 2D Implosion Problem
# Author: Matthew Abruzzo
#
# This is an input file for testing the new-style checkpoint-restart machinery
#
# In more detail, this mostly acts like a template-file that is used by the
# testing tool. In practice, the testing tool will:
# - provide a Stopping section and an Output section.
# - use the contents of Field:list to determine which fields to compare before
#   and after a restart (for new-style checkpoint-restart, the test can be
#   configured to skip this)
# Details are provided on the website documentation about how you can see the
# full parameter files that are generated in this test.
