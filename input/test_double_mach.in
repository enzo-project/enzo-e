# Problem: 2D double mach reflection
#
#  From http://www.astro.virginia.edu/VITA/ATHENA/dmr.html:
#
# Domain
#     0.0 ≤ x ≤ 4.0, 0.0 ≤ y ≤ 1.0 
# Boundary conditions
# 
#     The inner x boundary is simply an "inflow" condition, in which the
#     ghost zone fluid values are set by the initial conditions in the
#     post-shock region.
# 
#     The outer x boundary is a simple outflow condition. 
# 
#     The lower y boundary is constructed to mimic the wedge that the
#     shock is being driven into. For x ≥ x0, this y boundary is a
#     reflecting wall. For x < x0, the lower y ghost zone fluid values
#     are set by the initial post-shock conditions. Here, we take x0 to
#     be 1/6.
# 
#     The upper y boundary is constructed to follow the flow of the
#     diagonal shock such that there is no interaction between the shock
#     and this boundary. Given the initial condtions here, the
#     intersection of the diagonal shock and the upper boundary at time
#     t occurs at xs(t) = x0 + (1+20t)/31/2 (see "Fluid and Shock
#     Properties" below). For x ≥ xs(t), the upper y ghost zone values
#     are set by the initial pre-shock conditions. For x < xs(t), the
#     ghost zone values are set by the initial post-shock conditions.
# 
# Equation of state
# 
#     Adiabatic with γ = 1.4 
# 
# Initial density
# 
#     The shock is initially set up to be inclined at an angle of 60º to
#     the x-axis, and has a Mach number of 10.
# 
#     Therefore, the initial density is 8.0 for x < x0 + y(1/31/2) and
#     is 1.4 for x ≥ x0 + y(1/31/2)
# 
# Initial pressure
# 
#     P = 116.5 for x < x0 + y(1/31/2), P = 1.0 for x ≥ x0 + y(1/31/2)
# 
# Initial velocity
# 
#     vx = 8.25 cos(30º) for x < x0 + y(1/31/2) 
#     vy = -8.25 sin(30º) for x < x0 + y(1/31/2) 
#     All velocities are zero for x ≥ x0 + y(1/31/2) 
# 
# MHD Components
# 
#     There is no MHD version of this test. 
# 
# Fluid and Shock Properties
# 
#     Given the initial conditions described above, the sound speed of
#     the pre-shock gas is 1, and the shock speed is 10. Given the
#     geometry, the intersection of this diagonal shock with the upper y
#     boundary moves at a speed of 10/cos(30º). The movement of this
#     intersection is the reason for the changing upper y boundary
#     condition at the position xs(t) = x0 + (1+20t)/31/2 as described
#     above. This shock is driven by a contact discontinuity that is
#     initialized with velocity 8.25 pointing downward with respect to
#     the horizontal by 30º.
