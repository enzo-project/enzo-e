# runs VLCT MHD Passive Advection sound wave test
# - This should probably be transitioned to testing framework once it's created
# - This script expects to be called from the root level of the repository
#   OR at the same level where its defined
#
# Specifically, this script:
#   1.) Checks if that L1-norm of the error is appropriate for a sound wave
#       that has advected the a sound wave with a passively advected scalar
#       A sin wave is set up in passive scale (in terms of mass fraction) that
#       pi/2 radians out of phase with the rest of the quantities
