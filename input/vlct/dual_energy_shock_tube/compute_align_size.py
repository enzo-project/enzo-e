# Determining the velocity:
# In the normal case, we use a domain with stretching from 0 to 1 with 256
# cells; this gives a dx = 1. / 256 . We also know that the interval of time
# that we allow the cloud to evolve over is dt = 0.25 . Additionally, we can
# compute the sound speed in the hottest gas of the initial conditions using
# cs = sqrt (gamma * p / rho); canonically, gamma=1.4, p = 1, and rho = 1.
#
# If we are targetting some Mhat then we can determine the closest velocity
# that leads to a translation over an integral number of cells over dt. The
# number of cells is given by:
#    Ncells = floor(cs * Mhat / (dx / dt) + 0.5)
# We could further require that Ncells be divisible by 4:
#    Ncells = floor(floor(cs * Mhat / (dx / dt) + 0.5)/4 + 0.5)
# Once we know Ncells, we can easily compute the additional velocity component
#    velocity = Ncells * dx / dt
