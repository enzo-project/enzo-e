# Problem: Axis aligned Sod Shock Tube test problem for VLCT
# Author: Matthew Abruzzo (matthewabruzzo@gmail.com)

# Sod Shock Tube Test Problem along x-axis
#  - tests the dual energy formalism by using a background velocity-x component
#    with a Mach number of ~10 in the hot region.
#  - See the compute_align_size.py script for details about how exactly the
#    velocity has been selected.
#  - at t = 0.25 (the final state), the mach number ranges from ~10 to ~12.6.
#    dual_energy_eta is set to 0.00769 so that there are locations in which the
#    dual energy formalism is used as well as locations where it is not used.
