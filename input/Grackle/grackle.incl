#
#  Grackle Test Problem:
#
#  Sets up a cooling test without hydrodynamics to run many
#  one-zone models in Grackle, fully sampling the density,
#  temperature, and metallicity parameter space over which 
#  the chemistry and cooling/heating tables are valid.
#
#  When including this file to launch a simulation, be sure to:
#    - overwrite the entry in Method:grackle:data_file parameter
#    - specify a stopping condition
#    - specify an output schedule for the "data" output fileset
#      (or drop that fileset from the output list)
