  # Define the domain to be the 1D interval from 0 to 1

  Field pressure { floor = 1.0e-6 }

  # Global field parameters set in Field group

  Field { interleave = [density, total_energy, internal_energy] }

  # The grid is a "unigrid" array of 100 cells parallelized using OpenMP
  # Other types are patch_amr and tree_amr

  # Only physics method is hydro using ppm

  # Define initial conditions

  # Define boundary conditions

  # Define stopping criteria
