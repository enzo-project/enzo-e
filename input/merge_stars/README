ics.py a function called make_ics, generates a text file (called particles.dat
by default) with particle data which can be used to initialise the merge stars test
problem in Enzo-E. More specifically, it creates star particles with constant
masses, with random positions uniformly distributed in a sphere, and initial
velocities all of the same magnitude with directions directed towards the centre
of the sphere, plus an additional (optional) constant drift velocity.

make_ics can be imported by another script (as is done in run_merge_stars_test.py),
or it can be executed by running ics.py as a script, with command line arguments
being passed to make_ics. For more information, run "python ics.py -h".

images.py defines a function called make_images, which takes as input the
directories generated when Enzo-E runs the test problem, which contain snapshots
of the particle data at regular time intervals. It then uses yt to read the data
and then uses matplotlib to make scatter plots of the x and y coordinates of the
particles, outputting a series of image files, with each image corresponding to
a particular snapshot. These images are useful to check whether the initial
conditions were set up correctly and if Enzo-E ran as expected.

make_images can be imported by another script (as is done in
run_merge_stars_test.py), or it can be executed by running images.py as a script,
with command line arguments being passed to make_images. 
For more information, run "python images.py -h".

mass_momentum_conservation.py defines the function test_mass_momentum_conservation
which has the following behaviour:
- takes as the prefix for the names of the directories generated when Enzo-E runs
  the merge_stars_test problem, which contain snapshots of the
  particle data at regular time intervals, a name for the image file which will be
  generated, and a value for the tolerance limit
- uses yt to read the data and calculates the total mass, total x/y/z-momentum
  and total number of particles in each snapshot. It then calculates the
  conservation error for these quantities, and tests whether the absolute value
  is less than the tolerance limit. If the absolute value of the error is larger
  than the tolerance for any snapshot, then the test fails.
- generates a figure with three panels, showing the mass conservation error,
  momentum conservation error, and number of particles plotted against the number
  of cycles (i.e. timesteps).  This figure is useful for checking if particles are
  indeed merging (shown by decrease in particle number with time) and whether
  mass and momentum are being properly conserved.

test_mass_momentum_conservation can be imported by another script (as is done in
run_merge_stars_test.py), or it can be executed by running
mass_momentum_conservation.py as a script, with command line arguments being
passed to test_mass_momentum_conservation.
For more information, run "python mass_momentum_conservation.py -h".

merge_stars_test.in is an Enzo-E parameter files. Passing this file as an argument
to Enzo-E will run the merge_stars test problem.

Running run_merge_stars_test.py does the following:

- Generates the initial conditions file called particles.dat
- Runs Enzo-E taking merge_stars_test.in as a parameter file, and using
  particles.dat to make the initial conditions. This produces a set of directories
  which contain snapshots of the particle data at regular time intervals.
- Produces  a set of png images, which show scatter plots of the x and y coordinates
  of particles read from the snapshot directories.
- Analyzes snapshot data to test for mass and momentum conservation.
  This generates a figure (mmc.png), which shows the mass conservation error,
  the momentum conservation error, and the number of particles plotted against
  the number of cycles (i.e., timesteps). The test is considered to have passed
  if all the errors are less than some tolerance limit, which is 1.0e-6 in the
  case of double precision, and 1.0e-4 for single precision.
- Deletes particles.dat and the snapshot directories.

run_merge_stars_test.py takes a "launch_cmd" argument which is the command used
to run Enzo-E.
Examples:

To run Enzo-E as a serial program, run:
"""
python run_merge_stars_test.py --launch_cmd /path/to/bin/enzo-e
"""

To run Enzo-E as a parallel program, run:
"""
python run_merge_stars_test.py --launch_cmd "/path/to/bin/charmrun +p 4 /path/to/bin/enzo-e"
"""
