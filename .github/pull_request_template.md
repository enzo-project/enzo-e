<!--
Thank you so much for your Pull Request! To help us review it, please fill out this template to the best of your ability. Please make use of the development guide at https://enzo-e.readthedocs.io/en/main/devel/index.html

If you're unfamiliar with this process, here are some formatting basics:
  * any text enclosed by fancy brackets (<!~~ and ~~>, but you need to replace "~~" with "--"), is considered a comment that won't be rendered by GitHub after you post your pull request

  * GitHub will render all other text will be rendered. It respects markdown escape sequences to control formatting (e.g. lines starting with `###` specify a section-heading)

<!--Provide a general summary of your changes in the title above, for
example "Fixes crash in gravity solver in super-cycling".  Please avoid
