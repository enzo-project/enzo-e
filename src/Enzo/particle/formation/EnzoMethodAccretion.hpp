/// @brief  Implementation of EnzoMethodAccretion, a base class
///         for accretion methods. These methods compute
///         the accretion rate onto sink particles, and change the properties
///         of the particles accordingly. Gas density is reduced by setting values
///         for the "density_accreted" field. The "accretion_remove_gas" method
///         then subtracts density_accreted from the gas density field
