/// @brief    [\ref Enzo] Declaration of the EnzoFieldAdaptor class
///
/// The `EnzoFieldAdaptor` class is used to provide a common interface for
/// accessing field-like arrays from the `Field` class and `EnzoEFltArrayMap`.
/// We might be able to do away with this class once we make it easier to
/// construct an `EnzoEFltArrayMap` instance from a `Field` instance.
///
/// The primary motivation for this class is flexibility. Previously, reusable
/// procedures for computing derived fluid quantities (e.g. EnzoComputePressure)
/// accepted a `Block` instance as the primary argument and operated upon the
/// associated data. While this approach works, it's somewhat limiting since
/// `Block` objects carry a lot of unnecessary information. There are
/// situations where we would like to be able to compute a quantity without
/// needing the data to be directly associated with a `Block`.
///
/// Consider the following concrete example: the `EnzoMethodMHDVlct` Method is
/// a predictor-corrector scheme that needs to compute the primitive quantities
/// (including pressure) from arrays holding integration quantities at the 
/// start of the timestep and predicted after a half timestep.
///   - Integration quantities at the start of the timestep do directly map to
///     fields of a `Block`. This means we could use technically use the old
///     version of `EnzoComputePressure` at the start of a time-step (even
///     though this would obfuscate the control-flow)
///   - However, the integration quantities at the half-timestep do not
///     directly map to the fields of a `Block`.
///   - Technically, we could have forced everything to work by making use of
///     the field-history functionallity (possibly with a minor tweak), but
///     that opens a can of worms since other Methods' expectations about the
///     number and meaning of different generations of fields are not well
///     documented. It also would have increased memory usage, obfuscated the
///     control-flow and might complicate the porting of the Method to GPUs.
/// Additionally, the old procedures would always be incompatible with computing
/// derived quantities from reconstructed fields (e.g. one might want to
/// model a spatially varying adiabatic index in a self-consistent manner with
/// Grackle)
///
/// The unorthodox implementation strategy was selected to try to minimize the
/// cost of using this wrapper. A particular goal was to facillitate the
/// `view` & `ptr_grackle` methods of `ArrayWrapper` & `BlockWrapper`
/// to be inlined. (This would not be possible if the methods were implemented
/// and called as virtual methods).
