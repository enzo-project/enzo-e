/// @brief    [\ref Enzo] Declaration of Enzo's SourceInternalEnergy class.
/// This computes the source term in the internal energy due to the velocity
/// gradient along a given dimension.

// This is computes the source terms in a dimensionally split manner so it can
// be used for dimensionally split methods (like PPM) in the future. For this
// reason and because it should be applied in predictor-corrector methods (like
// VL+CT) at partial timesteps, this has not been operator split off into a
// separate method
//
// Like in Enzo's PPM method, this computes spatial derivatives in velocity
// using the interface velocities (as opposed to Enzo's Runge-Kutta method
// which uses cell-centered velocities).
//
// The calculation of the source term is not performed within the approximate
// Riemann Solver as it requires knowledge of the cell-centered
//
// As additional source (or loss) terms are introduced, it may make sense to
// introduce a class hierarchy to simply the implementation/application of
// source terms

  /// @brief    [\ref Enzo] Encapsulates the calculation of the internal energy
  ///           source term along a given dimension.
  ///
  /// The source term in question for the internal energy density is formally
  /// defined as follows. We define the jth component of the interface velocity
  /// as vbar and grid width along this dimension as dx. For all cell
  /// locations (i,j,k) there is a source term, over a timestep dt, of:
  ///     -1 * dt* pressure_j * (vbar_{j+1/2} - vbar_{j+1/2}) / (a * dx_j)
  /// a corresponding term is added for each dimension (although this
  /// implementation only handles a single dimension at a time).
  ///
  /// As in Enzo's PPM method, the cell-centerred pressure is computed from the
  /// internal energy (although the internal energy and total energy should
  /// have been synchronized at the start of the timestep)
  ///
  /// The current implementation ignores the scale factor.

  /// Computes the internal energy density source term contributed by the
  /// derivative of the velocity along dimension `dim` and add it to the array
  /// tracking the total change in internal_energy density.
  ///
  /// @param[in]  dim Dimension along which to compute the contribution of the
  ///     internal Energy source term. Values of 0, 1, and 2 correspond to the
  ///     the x, y, and z directions, respectively.
  /// @param[in]  dt The time time-step overwhich to apply the source term
  /// @param[in]  prim_map Map holding the values of the cell-centered
  ///     primitives from the start of the (partial) timestep (but after the
  ///     synchronization of the internal energy with the total energy).
  ///     The cell-centered pressure is loaded from this.
  /// @param[out] dUcons_map Map of arrays where the net changes to the
  ///     integration quantities (including passively advected scalars) are
  ///     accumulated. The internal energy density source term is simply added
  ///     to the array associated with the "internal_energy" key. The source
  ///     term for internal energy density is computed instead of specific
  ///     internal energy because this map accumulates the net change to the
  ///     conserved form of the integration/passive quantities.
  /// @param[in]  interface_velocity Array storing the values of the interface
  ///     velocity along dimension `dim` is stored (it should be computed by
  ///     the Riemann Solver). This should have the same dimensions as the
  ///     arrays stored in prim_map/dUcons_map, except along dimension `dim`.
  ///     Along that dimension, this array should hold one fewer value.
  /// @param[in]  stale_depth indicates the current stale_depth for the
  ///     supplied cell-centered quantities. The update using the
  ///     reconstructor's delayed_staling_rate should be applied at some
  ///     time after this function call.
