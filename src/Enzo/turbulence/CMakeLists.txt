# STEP 1: adds source files related to Hydro/MHD integrators to the enzo target
#
# in the future, we may want to slightly refactor the files in this
# subdirectory so that they can be compiled into their own subtarget (there's
# a lot here that the rest of Enzo-E doesn't need to know anything about and
# this can improve compile times)

# Get the list of source files in this directory & the fortran subdirectories
# - we do this using GLOB patterns. This approach is not recommended by the
#   authors of CMake (their recommendation is to explicitly list all files that
#   must be installed).
# - Some of the disadvantages of this approach are mitigated by inclusion of
#   the CONFIGURE_DEPENDS flag.
# - See the CMake Primer section of the developer documentation for more details
file(GLOB LOCAL_SRC_FILES CONFIGURE_DEPENDS

)

# TODO: Check if that file can be removed for good. It also not being used in the SCons build.
