# NOTE: this subdirectory was originally just named core, but that caused
#       charmc to produce an error message when it was called to translate a
#       charm++ interface file.
#       - The error message is benign. It occurs during cleanup in charmc when
#         it calls `rm -f core` (presumably to remove any core dump files), and
#         rm complains that it can't remove a directory.
#       - We choose to avoid that name in order to avoid worrying users

# Get the list of source files in this directory
# - we do this using GLOB patterns. This approach is not recommended by the
#   authors of CMake (their recommendation is to explicitly list all files that
#   must be installed).
# - Some of the disadvantages of this approach are mitigated by inclusion of
#   the CONFIGURE_DEPENDS flag.
# - See the CMake Primer section of the developer documentation for more details
