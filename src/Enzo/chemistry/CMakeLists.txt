#
# NOTE: in the long-term, the goal is to isolate Grackle as a private
#       dependency of this target. By doing that, we can rebuild Enzo
#       with/without linking against Grackle without needing to recompile any
#       source files other than the ones used in this target.
#
# We explicitly list files (rather than use glob) since that makes CMake better
# at rebuilds (especially after changing branches)
